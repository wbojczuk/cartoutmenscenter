        description: `I am a retired Captain of the Bartow County Sheriff's Office with 34.5 years of law enforcement experience. During my tenure as a law enforcement officer, I have seen the effects that drugs, alcohol, and other readily available substances have on the human body, their financial status, their families, their communities, and their lives.
        
I have always tried to do the right thing and help people when they were at their lowest, to pick them up and let them know there's a brighter day coming. I've tried to bring awareness about the effects drugs, alcohol, and other harmful substances have on the human body and how it affects the mind.
        
With my experience, training, knowledge, and the leadership of Jesus Christ and Cartersville Outreach Ministries, I believe we can impact many lives of men, transforming them, restoring them, and rebuilding them into the men they could be.`

        description: `For over 30 years I have struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. I could never get free. I was in and out of jail most of my life. I have been to prison 3 times. During my last prison sentence, I cried out to God because I was broken from the loss of my first child. Jesus heard my cry. I made a promise to God; If he would heal my broken heart and reveal the truth to me about my son, I would read His word and I would do what it says. Let's just say, I got a hold of the word (Jesus), and the word got a hold of me. My life has never been the same since. I go into Bartow County Jail and preach to the men and women. I am also an ordained Pastor through Cartersville Outreach Ministries.
        
Not only has God changed my life, but He has also changed my family's life. Hallelujah! God has blessed me with a beautiful, loving, God-fearing, Jesus loving wife named Kristy Williams. We are excited to see what is ahead.`
