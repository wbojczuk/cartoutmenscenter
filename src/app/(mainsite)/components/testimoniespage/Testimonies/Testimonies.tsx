<strong>Galatians 2:20</strong>
<em>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</em>
<br /><br />

I started out at a young age smoking weed and drinking, which led to pills, acid, hash, etc.
I played in or created bands and we would get high to play and played to get high.
I started to meet, what I thought was the right people, which turned out to be the wrong people, and was able to buy or be fronted large quantities of meth or weed, which I started to sell for a profit. This become my job and allowed me to have my band over all the time practicing.<br />
At one point, I was clearing about $5,000 a week profit and was able to pay band members bills. I was able to purchase vehicles for them, as well. Early on, I was making a lot of money. I eventually got busted and had to start working and learning many trades. However, I never made more than approximately $40,000 a year.
I got a job with a company and could utilize all of those trades on the same job. This led from making approximately $40,000 a year to approximately $160,000 a year, seemed like overnight.<br />
After a few years, I started my own business and my pay increased to approximately $400,000 a year. The amount of money I was making led to me being able to afford almost anything that I ever wanted. <br />
One day someone had some heroin, so I asked for a line, when they gave it to me they told me that it would take everything that I had and it did!!! I was on heroin 3 years, but it broke me mentally and wrecked my body physically.
After going to a methadone clinic, on four separate occasions, to get help, and going back and doing heroin again and again, I met these Pastors and was told to complete an application for Cartersville Outreach Men's Center. 
<br /><br />
I completed the application and was accepted into their program, where I completed the 8 month, in house program. During this time, I found Jesus Christ and was allowed to close all my addiction doors. Now, the high of The Holy Spirit is overwhelming, with prayers, Bible studies and isolation from all of my old running buddies, Cartersville Outreach Men's Center's strict policies has allowed me to sustain my sobriety, which I plan to continue when I leave the program completely.

<strong>Jeremiah 29:11</strong> -
<em>For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</em></p>

        <p>This place has changed my life. I've been saturated in the word learning who God is and who I am in Christ. The love has been so real and I feel like I am part of the family of the church. I am so thankful that the ministry has given me purpose and a reason for me to move forward in my life. Showed me how to love and be loved. I have been blessed with a truck and a job. God is real and He loves me. Jesus is the Way the Truth and Life. Just let Him direct your path. Thank you Cartersville Outreach as a whole for being obedient to God.</p>

        <p>The Lord has given me the honor to be the first Cartersville Outreach Men’s Center graduate, and I would like to share the incredible works which the Lord has done, and is continuing to perform in my life to this day.  I praise God for my helper, the Holy Spirit, and give God all the Glory! I praise Him for the divine opportunity being a participant to begin with, and even more, I thank Jesus for leading me every step of the way.
         <br /><br />   
        This program allowed me to disconnect from the world, plug into the Word of God, and establish a solid relationship with Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior. The only way this was made possible was through faith and prayer in God's Word. Developing this lifestyle of prayer really stood out for me as a strong suit, which led to being apart of our Intercessory Prayer Team, and after graduation, the Lord began opening multiple doors of leadership for me to be used in this ministry. The first door being positioned as staff (in-house facilitator) in the Cartersville Outreach Men’s Center. Other doors the Lord has opened for me is teaching bible studies at the Men’s Center and also the Good Neighbor Homeless Shelter each week. For the church specifically, the Lord has positioned me even in morning and evening recorded teachings, ministering the Word of God. This has been a truly rewarding experience to see how God can show up and restore peoples lives through the message of salvation and by the power in the name of Jesus. With all this being said,  I am truly grateful for all of the wonderful things this program has done for me, and for the opportunities to serve the Lord as a leader in Cartersville Outreach Ministry. ALL GLORY TO GOD!!! THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!!</p>
