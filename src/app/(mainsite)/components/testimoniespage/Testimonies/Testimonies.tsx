        <p>This place has changed my life. I've been saturated in the word learning who God is and who I am in Christ. The love has been so real and I feel like I am part of the family of the church. I am so thankful that the ministry has given me purpose and a reason for me to move forward in my life. Showed me how to love and be loved. I have been blessed with a truck and a job. God is real and He loves me. Jesus is the Way the Truth and Life. Just let Him direct your path. Thank you Cartersville Outreach as a whole for being obedient to God.</p>

        <p>The Lord has given me the honor to be the first Cartersville Outreach Men’s Center graduate, and I would like to share the incredible works which the Lord has done, and is continuing to perform in my life to this day.  I praise God for my helper, the Holy Spirit, and give God all the Glory! I praise Him for the divine opportunity being a participant to begin with, and even more, I thank Jesus for leading me every step of the way.

        This program allowed me to disconnect from the world, plug into the Word of God, and establish a solid relationship with Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior. The only way this was made possible was through faith and prayer in God's Word. Developing this lifestyle of prayer really stood out for me as a strong suit, which led to being apart of our Intercessory Prayer Team, and after graduation, the Lord began opening multiple doors of leadership for me to be used in this ministry. The first door being positioned as a volunteer staff member in the Cartersville Outreach Men’s Center. Other doors the Lord has opened for me is teaching Bible studies at the Men’s Center and also the Good Neighbor Homeless Shelter each week. For the church specifically, the Lord has positioned me even in morning and evening recorded teachings, ministering the Word of God. This has been a truly rewarding experience to see how God can show up and restore peoples lives through the message of salvation and by the power in the name of Jesus. With all this being said,  I am truly grateful for all of the wonderful things this program has done for me, and for the opportunities to serve the Lord in Cartersville Outreach Ministry. ALL GLORY TO GOD!!! THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!!</p>
