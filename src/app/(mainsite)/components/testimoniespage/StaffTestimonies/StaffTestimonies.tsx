        <p>I first started by meeting Pastor David and Pastor Mishie while incarcerated in Bartow  county jail, the love of Jesus they showed to me led to my decision of making Cartersville  Outreach my home church in 2022. Towards the end of 2022 I became a greeter, where God  moved me in due time to also be used on tithes and offerings, and at the altar as well.  Around November of 2022 I taught my first Friday night bible study. On November 26, 2023  the Lord opened the door for me to step into my calling where I became a licensed minister  through Cartersville Outreach and began to do some Sunday morning bible studies and  well as some Sunday evening services around the beginning of 2024. Febraury 12, 2024  Cartersville Outreach Men’s Centers doors opened where I started out as a part time  employee, soon after that I was brought on full-time, where I was then positioned as  Assistant-Director, then promoted to Director in 2025. Also on January 26, 2025 I became a  Ordained minister through Cartersville Outreach.</p>

        <p>I was led by the Holy Spirit to come to Carterville Outreach Ministry where I began serving the Lord.   Pastor David asked me to become an usher and greet people at the door and after I was there awhile, I started teaching Bible studies and preaching God’s  Word in church services.  I didn’t know God had bigger plans for me, but Pastor David was led by God to open a Men’s Transitional Center and wanted me to be a part of it.  I told him I would be glad to be a part of it, and when it opened I helped get the program started.  Now I am the Senior Staff Member over the Men’s Center.  I am able to teach, lead, and disciple the men in the program.  Since being at Cartersville Outreach Ministry I have become a licensed and ordained minister of the gospel.   I am so blessed to do something I love and I thank God for the opportunity to serve Him in this way.
