        <h3>Shawn Williams</h3>
        <p>In 2020, God changed my life forever for His honor and glory. At that time, I was a full blown drug addict. Not only was I a drug addict, but a drug dealer with multiple prior charges who had been in and out of multiple jails. I thought I had everything I could want or need to make me happy but inside I was miserable and empty. I was missing something and that something was Jesus. On September 1,2020, I was pulled over with multiple kilos of meth in the car, and that day my life was changed forever. I was facing drug trafficking at the highest tier and a gun charge. Even though it looked like I would be facing years in prison, this turned out to be the biggest blessing of my life. Through this one event, God revealed Himself to me in a mighty way like never before. For the first time, I hit my knees in tears and repented.He began to do a mighty work in me of cleansing and purification. Though I was facing 35 years in prison, it didn't even matter because for the first time in my life I truly had a relationship with God and His Son, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. A peace came over me that surpassed all understanding. I continued diligently seeking Him through His word and He set me free from bondage. Then He showed me His mercy and favor in the courts and set this captive free; free and on fire for Him and His kingdom. Today I am 3 years clean from all drugs and bondages and am being used mightily in the ministry, for God our Father's honor and glory.

        <h3>Tommy Williams</h3>
        <p>For over 30 years I have struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. I could never get free. I was in and out of jail most of my life. I have been to prison 3 times. During my last prison sentence, I cried out to God because I was broken from the loss of my first child. Jesus heard my cry. I made a promise to God; if he would heal my broken heart and reveal the truth to me about my son, I would read His word and I would do what it says. Let's just say, I got a hold of the Word (Jesus), and the Word got a hold of me. My life has never been the same. I go into Bartow County Jail and preach to the men and women who are incarcerated there. I am also an ordained Minister through Cartersville Outreach Ministries. Not only has God changed my life, but He has also changed my family's life. Hallelujah! God has blessed me with a beautiful, loving, God-fearing, Jesus loving, wife named Kristy Williams. We are excited to see what is ahead.
